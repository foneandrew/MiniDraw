MiniDraw
========

Basic drawing application

This is one of my favourite assingments that I have done at uni. It was the final assignment in COMP102,
which was the course that introduced me to java and my first real taste of actual coding. I went above and beyond
the requirements needed to pass the assignment (Core, Completion, and Challenge requirements), and as a result am 
pretty proud of the end result.

The project uses the COMP102 library that was suplied by the university to aid with io and graphics.

I have left the source files as untouched as possible so that it is pretty much what I ended up handing in.

We were supplied with some files, and then had to fill the rest in, and create our own classes. I completed the work
in bluejay.

I have included the orignal brief (AssingmentBrief.pdf), the orignal source files given to us for the assignment 
(AssignmentSourceFiles.zip) and a executable jar with the COMP102 library inside ready to be run (MiniDraw.jar)

Note: This was a very early assignment and as such my Java skills might not be as good as they are now (code layout and commenting etc). However the end result is still a very fun program with alot of neat features.
